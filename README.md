> Inkless DB is a modern, cross-platform desktop application for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.  
> Its unique concept is "inkless": you can explore, visualise, and manage databases entirely through the GUI â€” no queries required.  
> This provides a lightweight, intuitive way to understand and work with your data.
